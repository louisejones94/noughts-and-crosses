# noughts-and-crosses

This repo contains the source code for the first project of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course (March 13th - June 9th 2023). 

We are at the end of Unit 1: Frontend Fundamentals, so the project focuses on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Github pages: link TBC

___
## Getting Started/Code Installation

> Explain how the reader accesses your code. Include a step by step approach.






____
## Timeframe & Working Team (Solo)

Project 1 runs from 29th March - 4th April (5 working days) and is an independent project.


___
## Technologies Used

> List every technology you used to complete the project. This can be in one long list, or broken down into categories (Back End, Front End, Development Tools).

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript




___
## Brief

### Big Goals

- Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
- Use your programming skills to work out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
- Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
- Build an application to a specification that someone else gives you
- Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete from the same computer
- Craft a README.md file that explains your app to the world

### Technical Requirements

Your Noughts and Crosses app must:
- **Render a game board in the browser**
- **Switch turns** between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
- **Visually display which side won** if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
- Use **JavaScript** for **DOM manipulation**
- **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
- Have well-formatted, and well-commented code

___
## Planning

> The planning stage is important, as all projects in your future roles will have detailed plans before any coding happens. It is a great experience to share with potential engineer employers, as this reflects real engineering team practices. 

> Any ERDs? Same here, explain and include images.


### User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to start a new noughts and crosses game
- As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

### Sketches
> Did you do any sketches? If so, discuss this and include images.

### Wireframes
> Any wireframes of the front end and UI? You did? Then explain this and include images.

### Project Management
> Use a project management tool to plan the sprint? If so, talk through this - what tool did you use? How you allocated tickets/responsibilities, sprint timeline etc. Also include screenshots of this.

### Pseudocode
> Any pseudocode? 






___
## Build/Code Process

> The Build/Code Process will be the longest section of your ReadMe and will be most insightful to the engineers that review them. This is where you will discuss the steps you took to code the project.
> 
> You want to see your ReadMes as a way to walk the engineers through your approach and problem solving from the start of the project through to the end.
> 
> You'll need to include a minimum of 3-4 code snippets, highlighting code you're particularly proud of and these code snippets will have descriptions on what you did, how and why to set the context of the snippet you include. These explanations are important for the engineers, as they will want to understand what you did and the reasoning behind the steps you took.
> 
> You don't need to document every single thing you coded, but walk them through the key sections of the project build.
> 
> Some people will document the build/code process by discussing the key stages they worked on. Others will do a day by day guide. It’s entirely up to you how you structure this, as long as you discuss all the key things above.

___
## Challenges

> Challenges are great for showing your learning journey and problem solving, and this is a section that many engineers will check out. Every day of your engineering career you’ll encounter challenges, this is part of your growth and development. It’s the challenges you encounter that helps you become a stronger and more competent engineer. 
> 
> Here you will detail any particular challenges you encountered as you were coding the project. 



> Questions to answer here:
> 
> What technical challenges did you come across? 
> Why were these challenges? 
> What problem solving did you do to rectify them?
> Team dynamics/ Project management
> Tools/Tech you used





___
## Wins

> The Wins section is your opportunity to highlight the aspects of your project you are most proud of. See this as your chance to showcase these parts of your projects to the engineers reading your ReadMes.

> Things you could discuss here:
> 
> Interesting problem solving you did
> Strong sections of code
> Collaboration with other team members
> Visual design of the project




___
## Key Learnings/Takeaways

> This section is one of the other most important parts of your ReadMe from an engineers’ perspective and helps to differentiate each of you from your classmates and team members. 
> 
> Engineers love to understand what you learn from each project and how it has shaped you as an engineer. 
> 
> See this as your opportunity to show the engineers how your skills grew during each project sprint. 

> Things you could discuss here:
> 
> What Technologies/Tools do you now feel more confident with? Tell them specifically what you learnt about these. 
> What engineering processes did you become more comfortable with? Standups? Pair programming? Project management? Tell them what you learnt from these processes?






___
## Bugs

> If you have any bugs in your project, it’s important that you flag them in your ReadMe. This helps the engineers reviewing your projects to understand that you are aware that there are issues - if you don’t flag these, then they won’t have that visibility that you know these problems are in your code and it can result in them not having a full understanding of your technical knowledge. 
> 
> In either sentences or bullets, explain what the bugs are.
> 
> If you have no bugs, you can leave this section blank.




___
## Future Improvements

> It’s common to get to the end of your project and have ideas on what you would do if you have more time, as well as how you might improve it. 
> 
> If you do, you should detail this here. It’s great to give that context on potential future improvements, to share your creative or technical ideas with the engineers reading your ReadMes.
> 
> In either sentences or bullets, explain what your future improvements would be.
